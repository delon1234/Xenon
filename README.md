This is an Android music player app with the ability to login via facebook, use voice to control the music player like play/pause song, skip to previous or next song, enable/disable loop or shuffle. This music player is able to save songs in playlists and these data are stored locally in JSON. 
Take note Facebook Login currently is inactive as I removed the API Key.
Here is a link that showcases this application: https://youtu.be/f4RfnK2QyFA
